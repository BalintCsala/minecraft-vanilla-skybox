# Minecraft vanilla skybox

Implements custom skyboxes into vanilla Minecraft

## Usage

1. Press the green `â¤“ Code` button and select "Download ZIP"
2. Extract the folder inside the ZIP into your resourcepack folder
3. Download a skybox you'd like to enable. This shader uses the optifine format for skyboxes, so search for those (some of [these](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/texture-packs/search?category=&search=sky) work)
4. You'll need to find the textures in the resourcepack you downloaded. Try looking for a texture that has a 3:2 aspect ratio and looks like the sky. Pick one for day and one for night
5. Place the day and night skyboxes you found into the `assets/minecraft/textures/effect` folder and rename them `skybox-day.png` and `skybox-night.png` (Make sure you don't name them `skybox-day.png.png`)
6. Launch the game and enable the resource pack, then in video settings choose the _Fabulous!_ option for Graphics
